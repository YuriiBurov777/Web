**A little bit about me**

Name: Yuri

Last name: Burov

Age: 38

I have been working in the field of automation since 2007. During this time 
I have acquired many different skills both in
designing automatic control and control systems, and in
programming SCADA systems. But I wanted to become a C++
developer because I like programming and
I really get a positive mood from it.

I am glad that I chose the company Netology to undergo training
and education.

 I will not attach a photo, but I will attach a photo of my favorite 
vehicle.

That's all.
